## Definition

A private key is used in asymmetric key cryptography. Asymmetric key cryptography is based on applying mathematical functions to numbers to achieve personal secrecy. It uses two keys, one being the private key. If you think of decryption as locking and unlocking padlocks with keys, then the padlock that is locked with a public key can only be unlocked with its corresponding private key.

On the other hand, public keys are distributed to the trusted masses. This is done through a public-key distribution channel. This channel should provide authentication and integrity. Someone should not send their public key to the community pretending to have a different public key. Everyone should have their own private and public keys. For example, Bob only needs one private key to receive all correspondence in the community, but Alice needs _n_ public keys to communicate with _n_ entities in the community, one public key for each entity. In other words, Alice needs a ring of public keys.

## How it works at Atsign

A key in the atProtocol can be formed by using any alphanumeric and special characters (UTF-8) excluding "@", ":" and a white space (" "). A key in a secondary can be any of the following 5 types:

1. Public Key

   - A public key is a key which can be looked up by any atSign holder.

   - A public key should be part of the _scan_ verb result.

   - Format of the public key should be **public**:\<identifier>:**<atSign>**

   **Example:**

   `public:location@alice`

   > The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a public key.

2. Self Key

   - A Self key is a key which cannot be looked up any atSign holder other than the one created it.

   - A Self key should not be returned in a _scan_ verb result.

   - Format of the Self key should be **privatekey**:\<identifier>:**<atSign>**

   **Example:**

   `privatekey:pk1@alice`

   > The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a private key.

3. Shared key

   - A shared key can only be looked up by an atSign holder with whom the data has been shared.
   - A shared key should be part of the _scan_ verb result only for the person who created it and the specific person it has been shared with.
   - Format of the key shared with someone else should be  
     **cached**:**<Shared with atSign>**:\<identifier>:**<Created by atSign>**

   **Example:**

   `@bob:phone@alice`

   > Note: Above Key should be part of scan verb result for only @alice and @bob

   > The owner of the secondary should be allowed to update or delete the value of a user key.

   **More context on shared keys**: We know that Atsign uses _[AES-256 & RSA-2048](docs/reference/encryption)_ for symmetric and asymmetric encryption respectfully.

   - RSA-2048 can encrypt up to 214 bytes which does not constitute for a lot of data. However, because it is asymmetric, we can use it to ensure that you are you by verifying that you have your private key.

   - AES-256 can encrypt around a whopping 250 million terabytes which is practically unlimited. The downside is that because this is a symmetric key, we cannot use it to authorize that you are you since this is shared with the recipient.

   To remediate this, I can generate an AES(shared) key, and encrypt it using your public RSA key. Then we can decrypt said AES key using your private RSA key. Since you are the only holder of your private key, I can ensure that only the two of us hold the AES key. Now we can share information back-and-forth safely using the AES key as a means of encryption/decryption.

4. Private Key

   - Private keys start with an underscore(\_) and are not displayed in scan results. Private keys can only be looked up by the owner of the secondary

5. Cached Key

   - A cached key is a key that was originally created by another atSign owner but is now cached on the Secondary Server of another person's atSign as they were given permission to cache it.

   - A cached key should be listed in the _scan_ verb result for the atSign owner who cached it.

   - Format of the key shared with someone else should be  
     **cached**:**<Shared with atSign>**:\<identifier>:**<Created by atSign>**

   **Example:**

   `cached:@bob:phone@alice`

   > The person who has cached the key should not be allowed to update the cached key.

   > An atSign owner who has created and shared the key should be allowed to update a cached key, and if the "autoNotify" config parameters is set to true, the updated value should be notified (please refer to the `notify` verb) and the cached key updated with the new value.

   > If the person who originally shared the keys set the CCD (Cascade delete) to true, the cached key will be deleted when the original key is deleted.
