Now we will connect to our Raspberry Pi (which should be connected via ethernet or wireless to our network). We will be using [Putty](https://www.putty.org/), although there are other options such as [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/). To begin with, [let's download the software](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).


We will choose SSH (port 22) and our Raspberry Pi local IP address:

If you are using a public-key (if not, this step is not necessary), you will have to choose the directory where it is located, in SSH->Auth options:

After that, click 'Open' button, located in the main menu. The connection will start. Now we are ready to start configuring our private dess.
