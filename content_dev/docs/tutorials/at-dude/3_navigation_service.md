They are three service classes in the dude app, they are `NavigationServices()`, `DudeServices()` and `LocalNotificationServices()`. In this code lab we will explore the properties of these classes.


#### NavigationService

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class NavigationService {
  static GlobalKey<NavigatorState> navKey = GlobalKey();

  static GlobalKey<NavigatorState> nesteNavKey = GlobalKey();
}

```

This Class contains two static properties of type `GlobalKey`. It allows us to get the current context without being inside a builder method.
